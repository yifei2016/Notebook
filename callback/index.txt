There are two types of callbacks, differing in how they control data flow at runtime:
blocking callbacks (also known as synchronous callbacks or just callbacks)
and deferred callbacks (also known as asynchronous callbacks)

Due to their nature, blocking callbacks can work without interrupts or multiple threads,
meaning that blocking callbacks are not commonly used for synchronization or delegating work to another thread.
