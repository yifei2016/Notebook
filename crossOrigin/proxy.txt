## cross origin will happen, need to fill two conditions, 1: ajax(http request and not reload page)2: happen on browser.

## chrome 3000 ----react 3000--(proxy port =4000)--express server 4000

## chrome can not get data(asset) from express server with port 4000, and express server can not have the same port with
## http server 3000, so express server port is 4000, chrome can not get data from express 4000, so we need proxy
## to let http server get data from express server.
