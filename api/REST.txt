Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architecture style consisting of
guidelines and best practices for creating scalable web services.

REST is a coordinated set of constraints applied
to the design of components in a distributed hypermedia system that can lead to a more performant and maintainable
architecture.

REST has gained widespread acceptance across the Web[citation needed] as a simpler alternative to SOAP and
WSDL-based Web services. RESTful systems communicate over the Hypertext Transfer
Protocol with the same HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) used by web browsers to retrieve web pages and send
data to remote servers.

The REST architectural style was developed by W3C Technical Architecture Group (TAG) in parallel
with HTTP 1.1, based on the existing design
of HTTP 1.0.

The World Wide Web represents the largest implementation of a system conforming 符合to the REST architectural style.
