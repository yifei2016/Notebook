## mongoose is a driver to database, like express, it is a library(package, module).
Let node.js operate mongodb more convenient.
MongoDB and Node.js are often used together because of their shared use of JavaScript and its object notation (JSON).

### Mongoose is open-sourced with the MIT license and is also maintained by MongoDB, Inc. It provides an object data modeling (ODM) environment that wraps the Node.js native driver.
Mongoose’s main value is that you can define schemas for your collections which are then enforced at the ODM layer by Mongoose. Mongoose.js also has utilities for simplifying Node’s callback patterns that make it easier to work with than the standard driver alone.
In general, Mongoose makes it even easier to use MongoDB with Node.js.
