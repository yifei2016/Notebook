Single-Page Applications (SPAs) are web apps that load a single HTML page and dynamically update that page
as the user interacts with the app.
SPAs use AJAX and HTML5 to create fluid and responsive Web apps, without constant page reloads.

the main advantage of SPAs is that the app can respond to user interactions without fully reloading the page,
resulting in a much more fluid user experience.

As a nice side effect, a SPA also encourages the backend to focus on exposing data endpoints,
which makes the overall architecture more decoupled不挂钩的 and potentially reusable for other types of clients.

the main difference between SPAs and a traditional backend-rendered app is that we have to
treat the client side as an application with its own structure. Typically we will need to handle routing, data fetching
and persistence持续,
view rendering and the necessary build setup to facilitate a modularized codebase.
