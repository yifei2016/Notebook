big app usually use server side rendering with SPA, small app use only SPA.
A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or web site that fits on a single
web page with the goal of providing a user experience similar to that of a desktop application.

In an SPA, either all necessary code – HTML, JavaScript, and CSS – is retrieved with a single page load,[1]
or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions.

The page does not reload at any point in the process, nor does control transfer to another page,
although the location hash or the HTML5 History API can be used to provide the perception and navigability of separate logical
pages in the application.[2] Interaction with the single page application often
involves dynamic communication with the web server behind the scenes.

index.html(with client rendering)(in public) is spa
serside rendering with diff pug files(in views) is not spa
